                    Pets-R-Us are lifesavers! I have a hard time bathing my cat and they are always there when we need them. Peach is always happy after being groomed and always comes back smelling fresh and rosy! They also include a bowtie every time. Couldn't recommend
                    them enough.

                    I am a busy mom with three fur-babies to add to my little household chaos. But with the help of Pets-R-Us my beloved fur-babies have gotten the training I so desperately needed. They don't make a mess of every living room furniture I have anymore. Pets-R-Us
                    are literally so helpful when it comes to anything pet related. They answered all my questions and helped me be able to continue training my fur-babies myself. Five stars!!

                    There are times when I need extra hands to handle my dog Sebastian. He's a big boy so it's difficult to bathe him most times especially with my bad hip. Pets-R-Us always do a great job with their grooming services that Sebastian just loves going there.
                    If you are hesitant about contacting Pets-R-Us for their services, look no further! Book one now!

                        Mila is a young black cat from California. She loves cuddles from everyone and is always willing to play with anyone that shows her a dangly piece of string. Mila especially loves jumping on counters and finding new things to explore. She isn't afraid
                        of dogs and instead is friendly around them. She doesn't like treats, but will try to snatch up a snack if left on a counter for long!
